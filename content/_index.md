I am a French guy living in Wales who cannot get rid of his French accent. I work as a Govermental Data Scientist by day and as a Indie Game Developer by night. 

I am currently working on a video game featuring "John Space", an original character who is a mix of Buzz Lightyear and Indiana Jones, discovering new worlds, creatures and civilizations.
